🧑‍💻  4.1 What is Option(Inurance) :
        Option is nothing a contract but not to follow obligation means to follow the contact to buy/sell a stock a specfic price.
        Ex : TCS Spot = 4220
             TCS Aug 4400 CE = 15.30        (call Option)


             Day 0 Permium Paid = -15.30
             Day 30 TCS Spot Rate                   (cost of edgening)
                -> 4500 , so proft = 4500-4400 - 15.30              = 84.70 
                -> 4100 so you can/cant have to buy that share as per your marzi but loss is still there -15.30

            -> Contract Size         : 250 * 15.30
            -> Contract cycle        : 3 months 
            -> Exprtion date         : Aug (last thursday)

    @ In the money and out of the money 
        4100 -----   4220   ----- 4400
                    ( spot )
                      price

        Ex : 
        a. We thing that price will go up 
             - so we lock the price 
             - buy a call option
             - " Highest Permium "
            Excerise Price/Strike Price  <  Spot Price [In the money]

        b. We thing that price will go down
            - so we lock the price 
            - buy a call option
            " Lowest Permium "
            Excerise Price/Strike Price  >  Spot Price [Out the money]

        c. We think the price will be approxmitly same
            " Mid Permium "
            Excerise Price/Strike Price  ~=  Spot Price [At the money]


🧑‍💻  4.4 Option Pricing Descision
        Option Pricing is been descided on several factors :
            a. Spot Price of underlying asset
            b. Strike Price of option
            c. Time to Expiry
            d. Volatility in asset price 
            e. Intrest Rate 

        We formalized all this things then we get the Option Greeks
            - Delta : Change in Premium Price with respect to Spot Price  
            - Gamma : Rate of change of Delta
            - Theta : 
            - Vega  : Change in Volatility
            - Rho   : Change in Intrest Rate.

        TCS (Call Option) 
        " Premium is taken becoz to covering risk realetd to time , volatility , interset rate and dividends " 
        Spot : 4195
            Futuers Options :
                Excerise Price   Permium  
                - 4000 CE        219        --| In the price
                - 4100 CE        136        --| 
                - 4200 CE        70         --> At the price
                - 4300 CE        30         --|
                - 4400 CE        14         --| Out the price


        Call option strike = 4000 => 219 
        -> 219     --> 200 is Intrinsic value and 19 is Time Value 

        How the price is been descided :
        Based on time and money diffrence between the Spot and Excerise Price 

        * Ex 1 * 
        -- Intrinsic Value : spot - excerise  , |4200 - 4000| = 200
        -- The Time value means addition permium of risk for a time to Expriy  
           : 19 Ruppes is the time value money / permium

        * Ex 2 * 
        -- Intrinsic Value : spot - excerise  , |4200 - 4200| = 0
        -- The Time value means addition permium of risk for a time to Expriy  
           : 70 Ruppes is the time value money / permium

        * Ex 3 * 
        -- Intrinsic Value : spot - excerise  , |4200 - 4300| = 0 
        -- The Time value means addition permium of risk for a time to Expriy  
           : 30 Ruppes is the time value money / permium
