Chapter 3 : Introduction to Forward and Future Contract 

🌟Note (are the concept that are used by traders) : 

        - Opening price is descided when the exchange start collecting oder from 9:00 to 9:15 called pre market window and 7
          mins before markets opening

        - Closing Price is been descided as = Total Traded Volume / Total Volume  

        - Future Price = Spot Price + Cost of Carry
                       = Spot Price * [[1+rf*(x/365)] -d]
                       = Spot Price * (1 + R) ^ T                       
                        
                rf = risk free rate
                x = no of days to expriy
                d = dividend paid
                T = holding period of the asset (x/12)
                R = Cost of carry %

        - Efficent market : means where the buyers / sellers have the sufficent knowledge about the market and 
                            the market has 100% Liquidity where 
                                Acutal Price = Fair Price 

        - Actual Market   : where the market has patial liquidity and has exist of Transaction cost which helps arbiterage
                            Actual Price != Fair Price 

        - Fair Value (calculated) of Future it is calculated one by traders

        - Acutal Price of Future it is market price. 

🧑‍💻🧑‍💻 
3.1 Forwards 

    Bilateral Contract between two parties
    Terms freezed on contract date
    Both parties to discharge obligation (means the terms should be followed by two parties)


    Risk : 
        Counterparty : means one of the party should'nt follow the contract terms 
        Liquidity    : before the contract exprie date you cant get the money for the one of the parties.


🧑‍💻🧑‍💻 3.2.1 
Future 
    Forward + Standarization + Exchange Trade

    Featuers of Future Contarct :
        - Contract is done between two parties through exchange
        - centralized trading platform
        - Price Discovery by Market
        - Margin Payable - by both parties
        - Quailty and Quantity - Descided by Today


    Limitation of Future :
        - Lack of Flexibility (The Quantity of lot cant be descided by buyer or seller)
        - Higher Administrative Cost


    
🧑‍💻 3.2.2 
Contract Specification - Future  
    - Instrument Type     : Means in which category the contarct lies commodity , index or currency
    - Underlying asset    : Means lies in which specific asset oil , gold , stock , grains etc.
    - Expriy date         : Means the date you have sell or buy (on every month of last thursday) after that you take that stocks 
                            on that amount 
    - Open/High/low/Close : Open means on what price the stock is started
                            High means on today the stock price gone how much higher then the current
                            Low  means on today the stock price gone how much lower then the current
                            Close means pervious day at what price the stock is been closed after the market (3:30)
    - No Contract Traded  : Total no of volume / Contract Quantity Size
    - Turnover            : Total no of volume * price
    - Contract Cycle      : Generally in Indian Market the Contract Cycle is 3 Month  
    - Tick Size           : Minimum orice movement allowed for trading Instrument.    
                            (190.45 -> 0.45 is tick size) this is descided by exchange
    - Daily Settle Price  :  
    - Trading Hours       : 9:15 - 3:30


🧑‍💻3.2.3 
Important Terminolgies :

    Basis          : Difference between spot and future price    
            Greater the basis Greater the expriy of contract period

    Cost of Carry  : The realtionship between the future and spot.
        Ex: If i buy the share of ITC at spot of 494 at Quantity 1600   and i havew hold that stocks for 2 month 
                494 * 1600 = 790,000     and bank loan is at 12% , intrest value of 2 month : 15800 and we have store that stocks 
                sp depository cost is 400 so    total cost of carry = 790,000 + 15800 + 400 = 806200 / 1600 = 504 

                So diffrence is basis is 504 - 494 = 10 Ruppes         

    Margin account  : A Margin account is allow to investor to burrow the fund from the collateral securties(stocks , funds , bonds ,etc)
    
    Intial margin   : The minimum amount to buy/sell future contract.
    
    Mark to Margin  : MTM adjusting the margin account daily to reflect the profit / losses on the account.

    IV              : (Implied Volatilty) Means how comapny stock price will go [up / down] Ex : 23.3 means stock will go 23.3% up/down  

    Calendar spread : is technique that is combination of Long and Short Postion means if i buy the dabur Aug(+) and 
                      sell the dabur Sep(-) Future then loss is 0 and profit is minimal as compaer to amount to be invested


🧑‍💻3.2.4 
Postions in Derivatives Market :
    Long Postion  : The trader has buy in the future contract  
    Short Postion : The trader has sell in the future contract
    Open Postion  : The trader has buy/sell in the future contract and you havent Set
    Close Postion : The trader has buy/sell in the future contract has finilized the trade.  
    Naked Postion : Only Buy/Sell a Future 
                        Profit -> Unlimited
                        Loss   -> Unlimited

                    For this risk of Unlimited losses you have to do hedgeing with Loss is limited


     
 

                    
🧑‍💻 3.2.5
   Futuers Pricing Model : (means how the price is been calculating)

    A) Cost of carry Model 

        Synthetic Price of Future in Gold 
            Price of spot = 62130
            Borrows at price 1% = 621.30
            Locker Price = 20 Ruppes per 10 gram

            Total Cost  = 62771.30   (Synthetic price)

            But the acutal future price of 63000
            and the miss Pricing we get the arbiterage oppurtunity 
                💻 Cash and Carry arbiterage is 

                    - Sell the Gold Future @ 63000
                    - Borrow the money and buy the gold 10gm at spot price @62130
                    - Hold for 1 Month and pay cost of carry@641.30 
                    - Effective price is 62771.30
                    - Profit 63000-62771.30 = 228.70
                            No Risk + No Captial



    
        Fair Value of Future  >   Acutal (calculated) Price of Future

        Yes : (Reverse cash and Carry arbiterage)
            - Buy Future
            - Borrow the Gold
            - Sell Gold
            - Make the FD of money(Gold)
            - Take the Gold delivery of Future Contract
            - Return the Gold
              
        No : (Cash and Carry arbiterage)
            - Sell The Future
            - Borrow the money
            - Buy the Gold
            - Keep the Gold in the locker
            - Make delivery of the gold 
            - Return the Borrowed money


        @Cost of Carry (means the storeing the commodity)
                can we reduce the cost of carry by any chances and the answer is Yes 

                a. Convenience Yield :
                    Ex : Dividend Recived
                         Intrest Recived

                    Formula : Fair Value of Future = Spot Price + Cost of Carry - Inflows - Convenience Yield
                              F = S * (1 + RF - Q) ^ T
                              
                              whereas Q = Inflows + Convenience Yield


        Assumption :
        - Abundant Availablity
        - No seasonal Impact in demand and supply
        - Ease of Maintaince
        - Short selling is Availablity
        - No Transaction cost / Taxes / Margin Requriment


    B) Expections Model 
        Difference of Spot and Future Price 
            -> Due to Demand and Supply of Future
            -> Expections of Traders of future price of underlying asset 

        Various Lost during Transaction
            - Margin
            - Brokreage 
            - Taxes
            All the above one is not acutual included in cash and carry model 

        Future Price can Trade either 
        Permium [F>S] / Discount [F<S] realtive to the spot price of underlying asset . 
            # F -> Future Price and S -> Spot Price 
           
            - Contango [F > S]  -> Permium
                Market Expects the price of asset to rise in future

            - Backwardation [F < S] -> Discount
                Market Expects the price of asset to fall in future

            - Expections [F = S]
                Due to convergence theory on the expriy date 
                Market Expects the price in future and today will be same                      
        
    🧑‍💻 3.2.6 Use of Futuers
        - Hedgers
        - Traders / Speculators
        - Arbiterages 

    🧑‍💻 3.2.7 Risk of Futuers :
        - Unsystematic Risk -> Can be Avoidable  [reduce by diversification]
        - Systematic Risk   -> Cant be Avoidable [inflation , climate , war , etc]
