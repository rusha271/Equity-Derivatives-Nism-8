         so we cant store the oil because it will be costly so the solution is find the man which says the oil price will 
         go down so make the contract with that person for oil at the price of "100" ruppes with person after 1 years the price of
         oil is "150" so that person give me 50 ruppes and says go to market and take "100" ruppes oil.
